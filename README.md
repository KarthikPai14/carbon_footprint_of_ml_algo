# carbon_footprint_of_ml_algo

Accurate reporting of energy and carbon usage is essential for understanding the potential climate impacts of machine learning research.

We introduce an improved framework  that makes tracking of carbon footprint easier through standardized parameters such as version of gpu,  gpu usage, time of activity, epochs, batches and carbon ratio of origin of power

Utilizing this and by collecting respective data we aim to create an analytics dashboard that shows us the respective data relations and also answers some of the various questions that arise during the course  of this research

By making accounting easier and more accessible  we hope to encourage researchers to take up the sustainable  machine learning techniques and  also prioritize energy efficiency as a parameter.
